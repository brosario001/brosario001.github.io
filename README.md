This is  my first website that I plan on publishing. 
Why am I making this?
  I am making this with the hopes of accomplishing a few goals. 
    1) This will showcase my ability to create websites from start to finish.
    2) This will serve as a hub/portfolio for potential hiring managers that want to see what kind of work I am capable of.
    3) This serves as a learning project for me to learn about the process of making websites, as well as familiarizing myself with JavaScript.
    4) This will also serve as a way for my to learn some back end stuff, like learning how to host a serve, CI:CD, and other industry stuff
